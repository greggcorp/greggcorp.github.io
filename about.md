[Full Stories](https://slideslive.com/38894476/full-stories) (presentation): As designers of products and experiences, we rely on the wisdom of our personal and collective experiences, training, and education, and we employ tools to wrangle insights from big data. Yet there's much to be gained by going beyond wisdom and data. This keynote explores the role of context in user and product research, shares methods to think about and capture context, and explains how context allows us to make truly informed product decisions.

This short animated video will give you some helpful pointers.

[User Persona Research](https://blog.mailchimp.com/new-mailchimp-user-persona-research/): How MailChimp UX developed a clear idea of our current users so we could better empathize with and design for them.
