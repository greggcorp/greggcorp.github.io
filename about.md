### Some Words &amp; Presentations
[Capture the Context: Pro Tips for User Interviews](https://blog.optimalworkshop.com/capture-the-context-pro-tips-for-user-interviews): There's more to interviews than asking and answering.

[Full Stories](https://slideslive.com/38894476/full-stories) (presentation): As designers of products and experiences, we rely on the wisdom of our personal and collective experiences, training, and education, and we employ tools to wrangle insights from big data. Yet there's much to be gained by going beyond wisdom and data. This keynote explores the role of context in user and product research, shares methods to think about and capture context, and explains how context allows us to make truly informed product decisions.

[How To Create UX Personas](http://uxmastery.com/create-ux-personas/): A persona is a representation of a type of customer. Personas answer the question, “Who are we designing for?” and they help to align strategy and goals to specific user groups. So how do you conduct a persona analysis? This short animated video will give you some helpful pointers.

[User Persona Research](https://blog.mailchimp.com/new-mailchimp-user-persona-research/): How MailChimp UX developed a clear idea of our current users so we could better empathize with and design for them.
