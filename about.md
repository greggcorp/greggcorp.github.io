Gregg Bernstein establishes user research practices for growing organizations. As senior director of user research for [Vox Media](http://www.voxmedia.com), he spends his days advocating for and practicing user-centered product development. He speaks around the world about his work at conferences, most recently at UX Scotland 2018, UX Insight 2018 (Utrecht), UX Bucharest 2017, and User Research London 2017, and for such companies as Booking.com, CA Technologies, Etsy, EA Games, Fullstory, and more.

He built an innovative and influential research practice over his four years at [MailChimp](http://www.mailchimp.com), and taught design, branding, and typography at Georgia State University. In a previous life, he designed albums for punk and emo bands, and for clients in the music and advertising industries. [Visit the archive](../archive).

Gregg earned his MFA in Graphic Design from the Savannah College of Art & Design, where he focused on user experience research and design. He resides with his family in Athens, Georgia, and he enjoys long trail runs and cocktails on the rocks (though not at the same time).
