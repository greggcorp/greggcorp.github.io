For Optimal Workshop's ebook _How to conduct great user interviews_ I contributed a chapter on reading the wider environment around your research focus.

>The sights and sounds you capture add color, depth, and detail to your interview, which can be used to e ectively design and market the right products to the right audience. It’s a practice that top companies like [Ikea](http://fortune.com/ikea-world-domination/) and [Lego](https://www.fastcompany.com/3040223/when-it-clicks-it-clicks) perform to great success; both companies have incorporated home visits and observations into their respective research arsenals to refine their product lines and how they display said products.

>By observing and documenting everything, you’re able to flesh out the interview with all-important details that ground your findings in context.
