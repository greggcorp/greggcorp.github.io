Some writing updates:

### The Field Study Handbook
My friend [Jan Chipchase](http://www.studiodradiodurans.com/) is an authority on qualitative product research. He embeds himself in the field with a team of colleagues and fixers, capturing the context and ecosystems in which people live. He's the type of researcher I want to be when I grow up—traveling to the far corners of the earth to uncover hidden truths and potential opportunities.

Jan's taken his experiences and created the [Field Study Handbook](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/janchipchase/the-field-study-handbook). It was a career highlight to work with Jan as a technical reviewer on a few chapters of the handbook, and I'm excited for the book's release in June, 2017.

As we get closer to the book's launch, I contributed a short piece about what you learn about a product research team in the field. Check out [The Field Test](https://medium.com/the-field-study-handbook/the-field-test-5a243e71ff35) on Medium.

### Ambient Research
Last month on the Vox Product blog, I wrote about how I create an [ambient awareness of user and product research](https://product.voxmedia.com/2017/4/19/15309792/ambient-ux-research) across my product team by sharing everything, everywhere—repeatedly and redundantly.

It's clear to me that sharing findings in a way that makes them discoverable and teachable across an organization is the biggest challenge research teams face. Expect more thoughts on containing research in upcoming posts.
