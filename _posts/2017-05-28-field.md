My friend [Jan Chipchase](http://www.studiodradiodurans.com/) is an authority on qualitative product research. He embeds himself in the field with a team of colleagues and fixers, capturing the context and ecosystems in which people live. He's the type of researcher I want to be when I grow upâ€”traveling to the far corners of the earth to uncover hidden truths and potential opportunities.

Jan's taken his experiences and created the [Field Study Handbook](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/janchipchase/the-field-study-handbook). It was a career highlight to work with Jan as a technical reviewer on a few chapters of the handbook, and I'm excited for the book's release in June, 2017.

As we get closer to the book's launch, I contributed a short piece about what you learn about a product research team in the field.

>The field, though, is opportunity. Exiting the office and entering the field introduces novelty, variety, and a chance for adaptation.
