For _The Verge_, I wrote about Facebook's news trustworthiness survey. While its brevity is gaining attention, the real issue with the Facebook survey is poor editing:

>For their paean to minimalism, I salute the team behind this survey. However, the problem here isnâ€™t that the survey is short. Rather, the two survey questions are phrased poorly.

I want to take a second to admit how surreal it is to open this update with "For _The Verge_." When I was finishing grad school, _The Verge_ launched. I knew immediately that it would become one of my favorite websites, and came very, very close to introducing myself via email to see what use they might have for a UX researcher or designer. That I ended up working with and contributing to _The Verge_ a few short years later is a career highlight.
