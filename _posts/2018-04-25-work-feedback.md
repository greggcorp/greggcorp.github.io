**Some workplace feedback rules of thumb:**

I shared these workplace rules of thumb the other day, and wanted to expand on them a bit here.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some workplace feedback rules of thumb:<br>When someone who works for you does well, tell them and tell your manager.<br>When someone who works with you does well, tell them, tell their manager, and tell your manager.<br>When your manager does well, tell them and tell their manager.</p>&mdash; Gregg Bernstein (@greggcorp) <a href="https://twitter.com/greggcorp/status/988811097661693952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 24, 2018</a></blockquote>

***

When someone who works **for** you does well, *tell them and tell your manager.* 

Tell them because everyone wants to know how they’re performing. And tell your manager in order to boost your direct report’s reputation and signal that they might be ready for greater responsibilities.

***

When someone who works **with** you does well, *tell them, tell their manager, and tell your manager.*

Again, people should be recognized for a job well done. But that work might go unnoticed by those who need to know about it—take a minute to tell both your colleague’s manager as well as your manager.  Your colleague’s manager will appreciate the unsolicited feedback, and *your* manager is now aware of an employee with a good reputation (and your own magnanimity).

***

When **your manager** does well, *tell them and tell their manager.*

Positive feedback should travel up, too—managers should hear of a job well done just like everyone else. Go a step further and pass that feedback to your manager’s manager to convey your manager’s effectiveness.

***

When the only feedback is negative, good people leave, bad people stay, and everyone wonders why company culture isn’t what it once was. Spread the good news.
