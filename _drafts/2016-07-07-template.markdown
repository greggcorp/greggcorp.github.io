What makes us love the things we love? I wondered this after listening to yet another episode of the Poscast, a delightfully inscrutable conversation between Joe Posnanski and Michael Schur.

Joe is a columnist for NBC Sports, but that doesn't feel a grand enough description. Through his blog, his columns, and his podcast, Joe demonstrates his uncanny ability to tell meaningful, resonating stories. Rare is the writer who can accurately capture what it's like to move away from home; rarer still is the talent who can elicit tears and stifled sobs through his words.
